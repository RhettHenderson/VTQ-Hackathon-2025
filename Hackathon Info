Participated in the Virginia Tech Quantum Hackathon 2025 focused on practical applications of quantum computing.

Worked on problems related to Grover’s algorithm, quantum amplitude estimation, and circuit optimization.

Used Qiskit and Python libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib for simulation, optimization, and visualization.

Implemented parameterized quantum circuits to approximate Grover iterates with reduced circuit depth.

Analyzed CNOT gate count and accuracy by plotting RMSE versus circuit complexity.

Designed and trained shallow ansatz circuits to achieve faster convergence with fewer quantum resources.

Applied classical optimization techniques to maximize overlap between parametrized and target quantum states.

Explored quantum error mitigation strategies and the impact of gate noise on algorithm performance.

The VTQ hackathon consisted of 3 problem statements with Question 1 and 2 each having 15 parts namely a) to o). These two were independent of each other and led to part 3 which was the main criteria for deciding winners.
